  <h3>Welcome to the smart AI enabled portal of blood analysis!</h3>
  <p>If you’ve ever had your blood drawn, chances are that you’ve had a blood test where your doctor looked up the following statistics about your blood among others:
<br>
- The total number of White Blood Cells (WBCs) in your blood stream.<br>
- The number of Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Basophils, and Eosinophils (all types of WBCs) in your cell. This is known as a differentiated blood cell count.<br>
- The density of WBCs in our blood stream provides a glimpse into the state of our immune system and any potential risks we might be facing. In particular, a dramatic change in the WBC count relative to your baseline is generally a sign that your body is currently being affected by an antigen. Moreover, a variation in a specific type of WBC generally correlates with a specific type of antigen.</p>
 <h3>We will analyse your blood on the fly!</h3>
